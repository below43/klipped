Klipped App is a minimalist plain text scratchpad for iPad, iPhone and Mac.

Klipped has been lovingly crafted to be the app you always needed by your side.

It's a virtual post-it note. Store your ideas, or paste content from your clipboard. Delete the text when you're done. No clutter of files being saved, and no need to worry about saving your text - it will be there next time you open the app.

This repo is the PWA version of Klipped, and has been released as an open source project.
